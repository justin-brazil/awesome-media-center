Media center using docker-compose with Traefik, Portainer, Nextcloud and Emby.

## Overview

Traefik acts as a reverse proxy to expose the running docker containers, exposes ports 80 and 443. Port 80 redirects all the requests to 443, to enforce HTTPS. Services are registered as dynamic DNS entries in the host machine, that maps a subdomain for the respective container ip. Additionally, each service is SSL certified, managed by Traefik using Letsencrypt.

## Prerequisites

* Domain, with the subdomains registered
* Server
* Docker and docker-compose

## Installation

Each of the services is represented by a docker stack, containing a *docker-compose.yml*. For the installation to be more manageable, the only two service deployed by docker cli are [traefik](#traefik) and [portainer](#portainer). The remaining services will be deployed using [portainer](#portainer) to easily manage the stacks.

First, run trafik:
```sh
$ cd trafik
$ docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d
```

Next, run the portainer:
```sh
$ cd portainer
$ docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d
```

Now, that portainer is already up and running, we just add the stacks by adding each of the docker-compose files.

Any issue with the installation should refer to the [problems](#problems) section.

### <a name="traefik"></a> Traefik

On the *docker-compose.yml* one should change the property *basicauth.users*. The password should be generated by *htpasswd*, and for each character "$" should be escaped by inserting another "$" character.

### <a name="portainer"></a> Portainer

Should be deployed using portainer under stacks.

### Nextcloud

Should be deployed using portainer under stacks.

To setup wizard requires the following credentials:
* *user* - nextcloud
* *password* - secret
* *database* - nextcloud
* *host* - db:3306

### Emby

Should be deployed using portainer under stacks.

The volumes should be changed to match the wanted mount. The *UID* and *GID* on the environment are described in the section [User ID and Group ID](#user).    

### Transmission

Should be deployed using portainer under stacks.

The volumes should be changed to match the wanted mount. The *PUID* and *PGID* on the environment are described in the section [User ID and Group ID](#user).

### <a name="user"></a> User ID and Group ID

With the user you're running docker run:
```sh
$ id -u
```
returns UID for the user, and
```sh
$ id -g
```
returns GID for the user.

## <a name="problems"></a> Problems

Permissions on *data/acme.json* are too open then run:
```sh
$ chmod 600 acme.json
```
